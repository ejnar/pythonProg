Artificial intelligence is transforming the world.

From healthcare to education, AI systems are helping
people work more efficiently and make better decisions.

This video demonstrates a simple text-to-speech pipeline
built with Python, gTTS, and MoviePy.

First, the program reads this text file.
Next, it converts the text into spoken audio.
Finally, it combines the audio with a video background
and exports the result as an MP4 file.

Simple. Automated. Powerful.
